	      <p>SAIT Student enrolled in Web Development. I am always looking for ways to combine both my technical and creative skills. This is a big reason I fell in love with photography and currently falling for web development. I come from a customer service and social science background so user experience and a11y has peaked my interest and is something I think I may want to continue to pursue.</p>
